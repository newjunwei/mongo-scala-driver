# mongo-scala-driver is deprecated

`mongo-scala-driver` is a library that implements both field mapping
capabilities and databsae access to MongoDB from Scala.

It is deprecated. Instead use:

* [Subset](https://github.com/osinka/subset) is the next generation
  library that helps working with documents and sub-documents fields
  and build queries with them.

* [Mongo Java Driver](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Java+Tutorial)
  and [Casbah](https://github.com/mongodb/casbah) are official Java
  and Scala drivers for MongoDB.
